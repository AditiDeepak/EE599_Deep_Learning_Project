\maketitle

\paragraph{Project Title:}

Realtime Background Replacement and Super Resolution for Video Conferencing
Applications

\paragraph{Project Team:}

Adityan Jothi, Aditi Hoskere Deepak, Srujana Subramanya

\paragraph{Project Summary:}

In this project we propose to generate photo-realistic background
replaced images in real-time along with super resolution for video
conference applications using GANs. We will collect data from Youtube-8M
dataset and use some Zoom call recordings amongst the group. The project
will involve experimenting on different GAN architectures and loss
functions for two tasks: Background Replacement and Super Resolution.
It would also entail a way to transmit the encoded latent vector between
two applications to reconstruct the image with improved quality in
real-time. A successful outcome would be to produce a 4-5 minute video
call that is photorealistic with improved image quality. 

\paragraph{Data Needs and Acquisition Plan:}

We would be using videos similar to teleconferencing calls, interviews,
Twitch game streams, and more from the Youtube-8M dataset as a baseline
and include several recorded videos of Zoom calls amongst the group.
For the dataset generated by us, we would build an auto annotation
tool using segmentation model to isolate subject efficiently in the
video clips for labeling. The dataset is available open-source mapped
to YouTube videos that can be downloaded using the youtube downloader
tool.

\paragraph{Primary References and Codebase:}

We propose to build on the approach used in
\begin{itemize}
\item Olof Mogren, ``\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf}{Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network},''
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).
\item Blog Post: 
\item GitHub codebases: \href{https://github.com/olofmogren/c-rnn-gan/}{Convolutional-LSTM Code},
\href{https://github.com/HasnainRaz/Fast-SRGAN}{Fast-SRGAN Code}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Architecture Investigation Plan:}

Needs to be filled in.

\paragraph{Estimated Compute Needs:}

Needs to be filled in. 

\paragraph{Team Roles:}

The following is the rough breakdown of roles and responsibilities
we plan for our team:

Pick out of (Background Replacement GAN, Video Compression Pipeline,
Auto-annotation model for dataset and building training and deployment
code) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Adityan: Super Resolution GAN. 
\item Srujana: 
\item Aditi: 
\end{itemize}
All team members will work on the final presentation, slides, and
report.

\paragraph{Requested Mentor with Rationale:}

We request Professor Franzke to be our team mentor because he has
expertise in Computer Vision and GANs. Oliver is our second choice
because of his expertise in GANs. We have a good idea of what we want
to do and have a good starting point from the paper and codebase,
so we are flexible regarding our mentor assignment.
